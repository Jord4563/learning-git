# Learning Git
This is a repository I'm using to learn how to use Git.

Even though in the raw file there's a
line
break
in this sentence, it won't show up when parsed.

You have to have 2 line breaks to start a new line.

You can have *italic* and **bold** text!

_You can also **combine the two together!**_

* You can have list items in .md files, which is pretty cool.
* This is actually a pretty cool way to mark up text!
* I feel like this is better than HTML!

We can also add images!

You can add headers to the README, ranging from \<h1\> to <h6>.

# h1
## h2
### h3
#### h4
##### h5
###### h6
