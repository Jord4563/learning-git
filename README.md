# Learning Git
This is a repository I'm using to learn how to use Git.

Even though in the raw file there's a
line
break
in this sentence, it won't show up when parsed.

You have to have 2 line breaks to start a new line.

You can have *italic* and **bold** text!

_You can also **combine the two together!**_

* You can have list items in .md files, which is pretty cool.
* This is actually a pretty cool way to mark up text!
* I feel like this is better than HTML!

We can also add images!

You can add headers to .md files, ranging from \<h1\> to \<h6\>.

# h1
## h2
### h3
#### h4
##### h5
###### h6

We also can add quotes to the page! (I don't know why you would need to.)

> School sucks. - Unknown

## GitHub-only markdown

We can add code to the page and let GitHub style it for us!

```javascript
function annoy() {
  alert("Ha you can't stop this script!");
  annoy();
}
annoy();
```

We can add tasks to be done.

- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Incomplete task

Apparently you can have tables too.

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

There's more stuff, but I don't really care about it right now.

And of course, there's emoji! :grin:
